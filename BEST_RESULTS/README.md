These are the best implementations of the results as proposed in the paper: [TSRAD20](https://msoeken.github.io/papers/2020_date.pdf) Eleonora Testa, Mathias Soeken, Heinz Riener, Luca Amar√π and Giovanni De Micheli, *A Logic Synthesis Toolbox for Reducing the
Multiplicative Complexity in Logic Networks*, in *DATE* 2020.

* `EPFL_opt` corresponds to our best implementations for the [EPFL benchmarks](https://github.com/lsils/benchmarks)
* `crypto_opt` are the best implementations of the benchmarks as proposed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20190105040458/homes.esat.kuleuven.be/%7Ensmart/MPC/)
* `MPC_opt` are the best implementations of the benchmarks in https://github.com/sadeghriazi/MPCircuits

Note that best implementations refers to minimum number of AND gates.
